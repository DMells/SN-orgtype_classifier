- connect to localhost - org_type classifier
-Load dataframe - DONE
-Loop through each item of org_string
-Pass string to hosted server URL
-Fetch returned result (highest prob)
-Add result to df column
-Lookup result to find if company/not company
-Add probability to a df column too

Task 2
- Obtain first 100 org strings, and concatenate them into the request. - DONE

- Some org_strings don't output anything from the orgtype-classifier and results in a json error - could be that actually only takes up to 50 strings, not 100.
- Refactor org_id and classify_org as duplicate code 
- looks like you can pass multiple requests to companies house
- test to see if can just pass whole array to comp house rather than sleeping.
- need to output matched company name too from comp house api
- some of the comp house api strings have double spaces
- cant get comp house multiple string to work when passed as a list to chwrapper. Try curl and concatenating strings.
- terms like '001 TAXIS' don't return the correct response (blank dictionary)
- perhaps implement the save function, incase connection is lost for big data sets. Then, can build code to start from first blank org_id entry next time.
- build option to type in the name of the org string column. For example, cater data file has the org_string column with title supplier_name. Can also then add another which specifies which column to compare obtained_id to i.e. 'supplier_id'
- send email notification once all classified?
- tqdm is a cool package for progress bars https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/
