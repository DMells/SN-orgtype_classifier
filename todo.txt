-Add probability to a df column too - 
- Refactor org_id and classify_org as duplicate code 
- some of the comp house api strings have double spaces
- cant get comp house multiple string to work when passed as a list to chwrapper. Try curl and concatenating strings.
- send email notification once all classified?
- tqdm is a cool package for progress bars https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/
- output is creating an additional duplicated index column 
- check columns like org_type dont already exist before mapping to them

---------------COMPLETED--------------
- connect to localhost - org_type classifier - DONE
-Load dataframe - DONE
-Loop through each item of org_string - DONE
-Pass string to hosted server URL - DONE
-Fetch returned result (highest prob) - DONE
-Add result to df column - DONE
-Lookup result to find if company/not company - DONE
- currently starting from correct place but not merging old with new dicts. - DONE
- Obtain first 100 org strings, and concatenate them into the request. - DONE
- Some org_strings don't output anything from the orgtype-classifier and results in a json error - could be that actually only takes up to 50 strings, not 100. - DONE
- looks like you can pass multiple requests to companies house - CANT
- need to output matched company name too from comp house api - DONE
- terms like '001 TAXIS' don't return the correct response (blank dictionary) - DONE
- perhaps implement the save function, incase connection is lost for big data sets. Then, can build code to start from first blank org_id entry next time. - DONE
- build option to type in the name of the org string column. For example, cater data file has the org_string column with title supplier_name. Can also then add another which specifies which column to compare obtained_id to i.e. 'supplier_id' - DONE
- could just save after each batch, remove sleep timer and just force through until finished. - DONE
